###[JQuery Plugin:Accordian](http://chooowai.github.io/woco-accordion/) I used this plugin to contain the different sections of my content after struggling to find a way to display it in an interactive way

###[JQuery Plugin:backstretch](http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/) This plugin can be seen on my background image. I used backstretch to create a slideshow that would show up in a wide screen format, but also behind the logo on mobile devices
